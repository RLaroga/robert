         * Map
         *      -  represents a mapping between keys and values. It is used to store and manage elements as key-value pairs,
         *         where each key is associated with a unique value.
         *
         * Implementations
         *      - HashMap :
         *          It stores key-value pairs in a hash table data structure. Does not maintain any specific order of element.
         *          {@link Hash}
         *
         *      - LinkedHashMap :
         *          Subclass of a HashMap that maintains the order of elements based on their insertion order using a doubly-linked list.
         *          {@link LinkedHash}
         *
         *      - TreeMap :
         *          Implemented as a Red-Black tree data structure. It stores elements in a sorted (ascending) order based on their natural ordering.
         *          {@link Tree}
         *
         *      - ConcurrentHashMap :
         *          Designed to be thread-safe, allowing multiple threads to perform read and write operations concurrently without explicit synchronization.
         *          {@link CuncurrentHash}
